# Weather-Api-Visualizations

This project presents a collection of visualizations displaying weather data
from over 500 cities. By leveraging linear regression analysis, the visualizations
showcase the relationship between latitude and temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind
speeds.

Key Features:

Linear Regression: Each visualization includes a linear regression plot, offering insights into the correlation between weather metrics.
Comprehensive Weather Data: Explore temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speeds for the selected cities.
Informative Plots: The plots provide a clear and concise representation of the weather data, making it easy to interpret the trends and patterns.
