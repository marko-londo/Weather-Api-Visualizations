# Weather-Api-Visualizations

This project presents a collection of visualizations displaying weather data
from over 500 cities. By leveraging linear regression analysis, the visualizations
showcase the relationship between latitude and temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind
speeds.

### Key Features:

- Linear Regression: Each visualization includes a linear regression plot, offering insights into the correlation between weather metrics.
- Comprehensive Weather Data: Explore temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and
  wind speeds for the over 500 randomly selected cities.
- Informative Plots: The plots provide a clear and concise representation of the weather data, making it easy to interpret the trends and patterns.

### Folders: 

- Notebooks: This folder contains two notebooks; one for the process of
  obtaining the cities via OpenWeather API (WeatherApi.ipynb), and another for visualizing the data (Weather-Analysis.ipynb).
- Plots: This folder contains the plots used in the notebooks.
- Resources: This folder contains the CSV files used in the notebooks.
